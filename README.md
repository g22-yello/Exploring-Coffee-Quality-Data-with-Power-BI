## üìå Project Overview

This capstone project explores the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) dataset to analyze the factors that influence coffee quality. Using Power BI, we perform data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to gain insights into how sensory attributes, processing methods, regions of origin, and defects impact coffee quality scores.

The project not only highlights relationships between different attributes but also builds an interactive dashboard to help stakeholders explore trends in coffee quality across countries and processing techniques.

## üìÇ About the Coffee Quality Institute (CQI) Dataset

The dataset contains:
- Sensory evaluations (quality scores): Aroma, Flavor, Aftertaste, Acidity, Body, Balance, Uniformity, Clean Cup, Sweetness
- Overall score: Total Cup Points (sum of the sensory features above)
- Defects: Category One (black beans, sour beans, insect-damaged, etc.) and Category Two (over-fermentation, staleness, rancidness, etc.)
- Other metadata: Country of origin, processing methods, elevation, variety, and more

## üéØ Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to understand what drives coffee quality. Specifically, we aim to answer:

1) What are the key determinants of coffee quality as evaluated through sensory attributes (aroma, flavor, acidity, etc.)?
2) Is there a correlation between processing methods, origin regions, and coffee quality scores?
3) What trends or patterns exist in defect occurrences, and how do they impact overall coffee quality?
4) How do different variables interact to influence Total Cup Points, the overall measure of coffee quality?

## üöÄ Key Insights

- Ethiopia, Taiwan, and Tanzania produce some of the highest-quality coffees.
- Sensory Drivers: Aroma, Flavor, and Acidity are the strongest contributors to higher cup scores.
- Varietal Excellence: Castillo, Red Bourbon, and SL34+Gesha rank among the top varieties for coffee quality.
- Processing Methods: Techniques such as Double Anaerobic Washed, Semi-Washed, and Honey/Mossto strongly influence quality outcomes.
- Defects: Category Two defects are the most frequent and have a significant negative impact on cup scores.
- Environmental Factors: Moisture levels and altitude also affect production quality.

*Final Insight: High grade speciality coffee distinction arises from the interplay of origin, processing, defect control, and sensory experience.*
